# Issue 15: Implement Water State Logic

## Questions and Resolutions

### Question: How do I integrate the water state logic with the existing indicators?
**Resolution:** To integrate the water state logic with the existing indicators, follow these steps:
* 🌊 **Splashing**: Identify high market energy and volatility by checking for significant price movements and high trading volume. Use the Alligator indicator to determine if the market is active and dynamic.
* 🐊 **Eating**: Detect a strong trend in the market by analyzing the Alligator's jaw, teeth, and lips lines. If these lines are well-separated and aligned, it indicates a healthy, trending market.
* 💧 **Drowning**: Recognize low market energy and consolidation by observing the Alligator's lines. If the lines are intertwined or very close together, it signifies a lack of clear direction and low volatility in the market.
* 🏊 **Floating**: Determine if the market is in a neutral state by checking if the price is within the Alligator's mouth. This indicates that the market is neither trending nor consolidating.
* To implement this logic, you can create a new function in `jgtpy/jgtapyhelper.py` that calculates the water state based on the Alligator indicator and price position. This function can then be integrated into the existing data processing pipeline to add the water state as a new column in the data.

### Question: How do I calculate the water state?
**Resolution:** To calculate the water state, follow these steps:
* 🌊 **Splashing**: Identify high market energy and volatility by checking for significant price movements and high trading volume. Use the Alligator indicator to determine if the market is active and dynamic.

This function can then be integrated into the existing data processing pipeline to add the water state as a new column in the data.

### Question: What are the dependencies for calculating water state?
**Resolution:** To calculate the water state, the following dependencies are required:
* 🌊 **Splashing**: 
  - Significant price movements and high trading volume.
  - Use the Alligator indicator to determine if the market is active and dynamic.
  - Check for high market energy and volatility.
  - Relevant files: `jgtpy/jgtapyhelper.py`, `jgtpy/JGTADS.py`.
* 🐊 **Eating**: 
  - Analyze the Alligator's jaw, teeth, and lips lines.
  - Check if these lines are well-separated and aligned.
  - Indicates a healthy, trending market.
  - Relevant files: `jgtpy/jgtapyhelper.py`, `jgtpy/JGTADS.py`.
* 💧 **Drowning**: 
  - Observe the Alligator's lines.
  - Check if the lines are intertwined or very close together.
  - Signifies low market energy and consolidation.
  - Relevant files: `jgtpy/jgtapyhelper.py`, `jgtpy/JGTADS.py`.
* 🏊 **Floating**: 
  - Determine if the price is within the Alligator's mouth.
  - Indicates that the market is neither trending nor consolidating.
  - Relevant files: `jgtpy/jgtapyhelper.py`, `jgtpy/JGTADS.py`.
* Additional dependencies:
  * The function to calculate the water state should be created in `jgtpy/jgtapyhelper.py`.
  * The function should be integrated into the existing data processing pipeline to add the water state as a new column in the data.
  * The Alligator indicator and price position are crucial for determining the water state.
  * The recent 5 bars of data should be considered for the calculations.

## Additional Scaffolding and Logics

### Alligator Mouth State and Water Metaphors

The Alligator indicator consists of three lines: the jaw, teeth, and lips. These lines help identify the market's state and potential trends. The water state logic uses these lines to determine the market's condition metaphorically.

* **Jaw**: The slowest moving line, representing the long-term trend.
* **Teeth**: The medium-term line, indicating the intermediate trend.
* **Lips**: The fastest moving line, showing the short-term trend.

The water states are determined based on the alignment and separation of these lines:

* 🌊 **Splashing**: High market energy and volatility. Significant price movements and high trading volume. The Alligator's lines are dynamic and active.
* 🐊 **Eating**: Strong trend in the market. The Alligator's jaw, teeth, and lips lines are well-separated and aligned, indicating a healthy, trending market.
* 💧 **Drowning**: Low market energy and consolidation. The Alligator's lines are intertwined or very close together, signifying a lack of clear direction and low volatility.
* 🏊 **Floating**: Neutral market state. The price is within the Alligator's mouth, indicating that the market is neither trending nor consolidating.

By analyzing the Alligator indicator and price position, traders can interpret the market's condition and make more informed trading decisions.
