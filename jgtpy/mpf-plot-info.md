The `mpf.plot()` function from the mplfinance library has several options that you can use to customize your plot. Here are the main ones:

- `data`: The data to be plotted. This should be a DataFrame with columns 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and optionally 'Volume', with a DatetimeIndex.

- `type`: The type of plot to create. Options include 'ohlc', 'candle', 'line', 'renko', 'pnf', etc.

- `style`: The style of the plot. This can be a predefined style (like 'yahoo', 'blueskies', etc.) or a `mpf.make_mpf_style()` object.

- `addplot`: Additional plots to add to the figure. This should be a list of `mpf.make_addplot()` objects.

- `volume`: Whether to add a volume subplot. This should be a boolean.

- `figratio`: The ratio of the figure's width to its height. This should be a tuple of two numbers.

- `title`: The title of the plot.

- `returnfig`: Whether to return the figure and axes objects. This should be a boolean.

- `tight_layout`: Whether to call `fig.tight_layout()` on the figure. This should be a boolean.

- `panels`: The number of panels (subplots) in the figure.

- `figscale`: A scaling factor to apply to the figure size.

- `yscale`: The scale of the y-axis. Options include 'linear' and 'log'.

- `datetime_format`: The format of the datetime labels on the x-axis.

- `xrotation`: The rotation of the x-axis labels.

- `savefig`: The filename to save the figure to.

- `block`: Whether to block the execution of the rest of the code until the plot is closed. This should be a boolean.
