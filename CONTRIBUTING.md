# Contributing to jgtpy

## Reporting issues

- Please note that the issue tracker is not for questions. 

- If possible, before submitting an issue report try to verify that the issue
  haven't already been fixed and is not a duplicate.


## Submitting patches

If you contribute code to jgtpy, you agree to license your code under the MIT.

The new code should follow [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) coding style (except
the line length limit, which is 90) and adhere to the style of 
the surrounding code.

You must document any functionality using Sphinx-compatible RST, and
implement tests for any functionality in the `test` directory.

In your Pull Requests there's no need to fill the changelog or AUTHORS,
this is a maintainer's responsibility.

### Setup

1.  Create a virtualenv
2.  Install `jgtpy` in editable mode along with dev dependencies:

        pip install -e ".[dev]"

3.  Ensure that tests pass

        make test


### Running tests

To run the full test suite:

    make test

Or simply:

    pytest

Before pushing your code, make sure that linting passes, otherwise Travis
build would fail:

    make lint


### Building docs

    make docs

Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` with a browser to see the docs. On macOS you 
can use the following command for that:

    open docs/_build/html/index.html
