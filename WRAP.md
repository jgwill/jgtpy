# JGTPy Project Evolution and Current Capabilities

## Introduction

The JGTPy project has undergone significant evolution, enhancing its capabilities in providing CDS, IDS, and PDSP services. This document outlines the journey of the project, highlighting key milestones, and discussing the current functionalities it offers.

## Evolution of the Project

### Initial Phase

The project began with a focus on financial data analysis, leveraging Python for technical indicators and pattern recognition. Early versions introduced basic functionalities, as seen in the [`mfihelper.py`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2Fjgtpy%2Fmfihelper.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/jgtpy/mfihelper.py") module, which included utilities for market flow indicators.

### Expansion and Integration

As the project matured, it expanded to include a wider range of technical indicators and data analysis tools. The introduction of modules like [`JGTIDS.py`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2FSTC.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22JGTIDS.py%22%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/STC.md") marked a significant enhancement, offering advanced indicators for trading strategies.

### Automation and Build Process

The build process saw improvements with the creation of scripts like [`build-n-release.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2Fscripts%2Fbuild-n-release.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22build-n-release.sh%22%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/scripts/build-n-release.sh"), which automated versioning, packaging, and publishing. This streamlined the development cycle and facilitated continuous integration and delivery.

### Documentation and Community Engagement

Efforts were made to improve documentation and engage with the community. The [`STC.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2FSTC.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/STC.md") document provided clarity on the package's direction, while the [`gh-pages-refresh.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2Fgh-pages-refresh.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/gh-pages-refresh.sh") script automated the generation and publishing of documentation, improving accessibility for users.

## Current Capabilities

### Build and Release Automation

The project supports automated build and release processes, making it easier for contributors to publish updates. The [`scripts/build-n-release.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2Fscripts%2Fbuild-n-release.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/scripts/build-n-release.sh") script handles versioning, building, and publishing to package repositories.

### Enhanced Documentation

Documentation has been significantly improved, providing users with clear guidance on utilizing the project's features. The automated documentation generation and publishing process ensure that the documentation is always up to date.

### Community and Contribution

The project has established a framework for community engagement and contributions, as evidenced by the [`AUTHORS`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2FAUTHORS%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/AUTHORS") and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fa%2Fsrc%2F_jgt%2Fids%2FCONTRIBUTING.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/a/src/_jgt/ids/CONTRIBUTING.md") files. This encourages collaboration and ensures the project's continued growth.
