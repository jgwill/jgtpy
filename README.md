### IDS Purpose

The `jgtpy/JGTIDS.py` file is responsible for generating and managing IDS (Indicator Data Service) files. The `jgtids` script, exposed through `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`, provides functionalities to create IDS files, read IDS files, and perform other related operations. Here is a detailed documentation of the purpose of JGTIDS and what end-results it produces in terms of data for `JGTCDS.py`:

* **Purpose of JGTIDS** 📊
  - The main purpose of `JGTIDS.py` is to add various technical indicators to the financial market data. These indicators are used for market analysis and trading decisions.
  - The module processes the input data and adds indicators such as the Alligator indicator, Awesome Oscillator (AO), Acceleration/Deceleration Oscillator (AC), fractals, and Market Facilitation Index (MFI).
  - The module also generates buy and sell signals based on the technical indicators. These signals include fractal divergent bar signals, zero line cross signals, and zone signals.

* **End-Results Produced for JGTCDS.py** 📈
  - The processed data with added indicators and signals is used as input for `JGTCDS.py` to create Chaos Data Service (CDS) files.
  - The indicators and signals added by `JGTIDS.py` are essential for generating the CDS files, which are used for further analysis and charting.
  - The columns added by `JGTIDS.py` include various technical indicators and signals, which are documented in the `docs/IDS_data_columns.md` file.

* **Data Flow** 🔄
  - The input data is read from Price Data Service (PDS) files.

  - **get_higher_cdf**: This function retrieves the CDS data for a higher timeframe of a given instrument and timeframe based on a specified level.


## jgtads: Advanced Data Service Analytics CLI

`jgtads` is the command-line gateway to Advanced Data Service (ADS) analytics and visualizations. It empowers you to:

- Generate and plot ADS analytics from Chaos Data Service (CDS) or Price Data Service (PDS) files.
- Compute and visualize technical indicators and trading signals.
- Output interactive or static charts, analytics CSVs, and signal summaries.

**Typical usage:**

```sh
jgtads --instrument EURUSD --timeframe H1 --show --save_figure my_analytics.png
```

Or, to save with auto-naming:

```sh
jgtads --instrument EURUSD --timeframe H1 --save_figure charts/ --save_figure_as_timeframe
```

- `--instrument` and `--timeframe` are required.
- Use `--show` to display, or `--save_figure` to save.
- No `--input`, `--output`, `--indicators`, or `--signals` options exist.

> Like a fractal lens, `jgtads` reveals the hidden patterns in your market data—one invocation, many insights.
